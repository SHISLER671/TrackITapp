## üîÑ Complete Daily Workflow

### Part 1: Morning Loading (Warehouse)

**Objective:** Load assigned kegs onto your truck

**Steps:**
1. Clock in to work
2. Get company phone from supervisor (already logged into your driver account)
3. Open app ‚Üí You're on the dashboard
4. Walk to your assigned keg pile
5. Tap "üì∑ Scan Keg"
6. **Scan each keg's QR code one by one:**
   ```
   Scan Keg #1 ‚Üí "‚úì Keg-001 loaded"
   Scan Keg #2 ‚Üí "‚úì Keg-002 loaded"
   Scan Keg #3 ‚Üí "‚úì Keg-003 loaded"
   ...
   ```
7. As you scan, physically load them onto truck
8. Dashboard updates: "Kegs On Truck: 12"

**Database Updates:**
- Each scan updates `kegs.current_holder` to your driver ID
- Records `last_scan` timestamp
- Creates entry in `keg_scans` table

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes for 12 kegs

---

### Part 2: Create Delivery (Before Each Stop)

**Objective:** Notify restaurant you're coming with specific kegs

**When:** Ideally before leaving warehouse or while en route

**Steps:**
1. Tap "Create Delivery" on dashboard (or nav menu)
2. **Select Destination:**
   - Choose restaurant from dropdown
   - Example: "Restaurant abc123"
3. **Select Kegs:**
   - Checkboxes for each keg on truck
   - Or tap "Select All" if delivering everything to this stop
   - Each keg shows: Name, Type, Size, Deposit ($30)
4. **Add Notes (Optional):**
   - "Arriving at 2:30 PM"
   - "Call when outside - back entrance"
5. Tap "üì¶ Create Delivery"
6. **Confirmation:** 
   ```
   ‚úÖ Delivery created!
   3 kegs ready for drop-off.
   The restaurant manager will be notified.
   ```

**What Happens:**
- Creates entry in `deliveries` table (status: PENDING)
- Creates entries in `delivery_items` table
- Restaurant manager sees pending delivery on their dashboard
- You can track status on your dashboard

**Time:** ~30 seconds per delivery

---

### Part 3: At Restaurant (Drop-Off)

**Objective:** Physically deliver kegs, get digital acceptance

**Your Actions:**
1. **Park and unload** kegs physically
2. **Hand over to manager** (or leave at designated spot)
3. **Manager's job:** They open their app and accept delivery
4. **You wait** for confirmation (usually 15 seconds)
5. **Get notification:** "‚úÖ Delivery accepted"

**You DO NOT scan anything here!** 
- Manager scans or accepts on their phone
- This creates the blockchain receipt
- Updates keg ownership from you to restaurant

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- Manager taps "Accept & Sign" on their app
- Blockchain transaction executes (NFT transfer)
- `deliveries.status` updates to ACCEPTED
- `kegs.current_holder` updates to restaurant
- Your dashboard updates: "Kegs On Truck" decreases

**Time:** ~15 seconds (for manager to accept)

**Your Dashboard Update:**
- "Pending Deliveries" decreases by 1
- "Completed Today" increases by 1
- "Kegs On Truck" decreases by delivered count

---

### Part 4: Multiple Stops

Repeat Parts 2 & 3 for each stop on your route:

```
Stop 1: Create delivery ‚Üí Drop off ‚Üí Wait for acceptance
Stop 2: Create delivery ‚Üí Drop off ‚Üí Wait for acceptance
Stop 3: Create delivery ‚Üí Drop off ‚Üí Wait for acceptance
...
```

**Route Optimization Tips:**
- Create all deliveries at start of day (if known)
- Or create each delivery 10 minutes before arriving
- Gives managers advance notice

---

### Part 5: End of Day (Return to Warehouse)

**Objective:** Return empty kegs, complete shift

**Empty Kegs Handling:**

**Option A: Supervisor Handles**
- You physically drop empties at designated area
- Supervisor scans them in later
- You're done - hand phone back

**Option B: You Scan Them**
1. Tap "üì∑ Scan Keg"
2. Scan each empty's QR code
3. App detects it's empty (from POS data)
4. Updates to "returned to brewery"
5. `kegs.current_holder` becomes NULL or warehouse

**Shift Completion:**
- Review dashboard: All deliveries should be ACCEPTED
- Check "Kegs On Truck" = 0 (or just empties)
- Hand phone to supervisor
- Clock out

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes for scanning empties

## üìä What You See vs What Manager Sees

### Your View (Driver Dashboard)
```
Kegs On Truck: 12
Pending Deliveries: 1 (waiting for acceptance)
Completed Today: 2

Recent Deliveries:
- Restaurant abc123 | 3 kegs | ACCEPTED ‚úÖ
- Restaurant def456 | 5 kegs | PENDING ‚è≥
```

### Manager's View (Restaurant Dashboard)
```
Pending Deliveries: 1 REQUIRES ACTION

[Accept & Sign] [Reject]
```

## üö® Exception Handling

### Scenario 1: Manager Not Accepting
**Problem:** You delivered kegs but manager hasn't accepted yet

**What You See:**
- Dashboard shows "Pending Deliveries: 1"
- Orange badge "PENDING"

**What To Do:**
1. Give it 2-3 minutes (they might be busy)
2. Call/text manager: "Hey, delivered 3 kegs, can you accept in the app?"
3. Wait for notification
4. If still pending after 10 min, contact dispatch

---

### Scenario 2: Manager Rejects Delivery
**Problem:** Manager says "Wrong beer" or "Didn't order this"

**What You See:**
- Notification: "‚ùå Delivery rejected - Wrong beer style"
- Dashboard shows "REJECTED" status

**What To Do:**
1. Load kegs back onto truck
2. Call dispatch/supervisor
3. Kegs still in your possession (current_holder = you)
4. Supervisor will reassign or return to brewery

---

### Scenario 3: Damaged Keg
**Problem:** Notice keg is dented/damaged while loading

**What To Do:**
1. Scan it anyway (to track it)
2. In delivery notes, write: "Keg-123 damaged - photo attached"
3. Take photo (future feature)
4. Notify supervisor
5. Still deliver or set aside per company policy

---

### Scenario 4: Picking Up Empties at Stop
**Problem:** Restaurant has empties to return

**What To Do:**

**Option A (Recommended):**
- Load empties onto truck physically
- **Don't scan them yet**
- Scan when back at warehouse

**Option B:**
- Scan empties at restaurant
- App marks them as "in your possession"
- Scan again at warehouse to complete return

**Why:** Keeps full kegs and empties separate in system

---

## üîê Blockchain for Drivers

### What Happens When Manager Accepts?

1. **Manager taps "Accept & Sign"**
2. **Blockchain transaction executes:**
   - Transfers NFT ownership from your wallet to restaurant wallet
   - Creates immutable receipt with transaction hash
   - Example: `0xabc123...` on Base blockchain
3. **You get confirmation:**
   - "‚úÖ Delivery accepted"
   - "Blockchain TX: 0xabc123..."

### Why This Matters for You

| Old Way (Paper) | New Way (Blockchain) |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Manager can lose signature | Signature permanent on blockchain |
| Disputes: "I never got 5 kegs" | Blockchain shows exact count |
| You're liable if paper lost | Blockchain proves you delivered |

**Bottom Line:** Protects you from false claims!

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Scan while loading** - Don't batch scan, scan as you go
2. **Create deliveries early** - Managers appreciate advance notice
3. **Use notes** - ETA, special instructions
4. **Check pending before leaving** - Don't leave if manager hasn't accepted
5. **Keep phone charged** - Critical for scanning
6. **Report broken QR codes** - Supervisor can reprint
7. **Screenshot completed deliveries** - If you want personal records
