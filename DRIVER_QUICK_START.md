### Before Each Stop: Create Delivery (30 seconds)

**Quick Process:**

1. **Tap "Create Delivery"**
2. **Select Restaurant** (dropdown)
3. **Check kegs** you're dropping off
   - Or tap "Select All" if dropping everything
4. **Add note** (optional): "Arriving at 2 PM"
5. **Tap "Create Delivery"**

**Done!** Restaurant manager gets notified.

---

### At Restaurant: Wait for Manager (15 seconds)

**You don't scan anything here!**

The manager does this:
1. Opens their app
2. Sees your delivery
3. Taps "Accept & Sign"
4. You get notification: "✅ Delivery accepted"

**Your job:** Unload physically, wait for confirmation, leave!

---

### End of Day: Return Empties (2-3 minutes)

**Back at warehouse:**

1. **Scan each empty** keg
   - App knows it's empty (from POS data or manual marking)
   - Updates to "returned to brewery"

2. **Done!** Hand phone to supervisor, clock out

---

## 🚨 Common Situations

### "Manager isn't accepting the delivery"
- Check your "Pending Deliveries" on dashboard
- Status will show "PENDING" with orange badge
- Manager might be busy - give them a call
- Delivery stays pending until they accept

### "I scanned the wrong keg"
- Before creating delivery: Just don't select it
- After creating delivery: Contact supervisor to cancel

### "Restaurant rejected delivery"
- You'll get notification: "❌ Delivery rejected - [reason]"
- Take kegs back on truck
- Contact dispatch

## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Scan while loading** - Don't wait until all kegs are loaded
2. **Create deliveries before arriving** - Manager gets advance notice
3. **Use notes field** - "ETA 2:30 PM" or "Call when outside"
4. **Check "Pending" before leaving** - Make sure manager accepted
5. **Keep phone charged** - You need it for scanning

## 🎯 App vs Physical Work

| Your Job | App Job |
|----------|---------|
| Physical loading | Scan to track |
| Drive truck | App tracks GPS |
| Physical unloading | Manager scans to accept |
| Physical empties return | Scan to close loop |

**Bottom line:** You do the physical work, app tracks it. Minimal app time!

## 🆚 Old Way vs New Way

| Paper Manifest | This App |
|----------------|----------|
| Write down keg IDs | Scan = automatic |
| Get signature on paper | Manager signs digitally (faster) |
| Turn in papers at end | All automatic |
| Lost paperwork = nightmare | Blockchain = never lost |

You both save time, less hassle, everyone's happy.
