## üé¨ How It Works

### Driver Perspective

**Morning: Load Truck (2-3 min)**
1. Open app ‚Üí Tap "Scan Keg"
2. Scan each keg's QR code one by one
3. "‚úì Keg loaded" confirmation for each
4. Drive away - kegs show in "Kegs On Truck"

**Before Each Stop: Create Delivery (30 sec)**
1. Tap "Create Delivery"
2. Select restaurant from dropdown
3. Check kegs you're dropping off
4. Optional: Add note ("ETA 2:30 PM")
5. Tap "Create" ‚Üí Manager notified

**At Restaurant: Wait for Manager (15 sec)**
1. Unload kegs physically
2. Manager accepts on their phone
3. You get "‚úÖ Delivery accepted" notification
4. Drive to next stop

**End of Day: Return Empties (2-3 min)**
1. Scan empty kegs back at warehouse
2. Hand phone to supervisor
3. Done!

**Total app time: ~8 minutes per day**

---

### Manager Perspective

### When Driver Arrives

1. **Manager opens restaurant dashboard** on phone
2. **Sees pending delivery** at top of page (auto-refreshes every 30s):
   ```
   üöö DELIVERY ARRIVED
   from Hop City Brewing
   
   ‚úì Hazy IPA (1/2BBL) - $30
   ‚úì Pilsner (1/4BBL) - $30
   ‚úì Stout (1/2BBL) - $30
   
   Total: 3 kegs, $90 deposit
   
   [Accept & Sign]  [Reject]
   ```

3. **Taps "Accept & Sign"** button
4. **Confirms with Face ID** (or thumbprint)
5. **Done!** - 15 seconds total

### Behind the Scenes (Automatic)
- ‚úÖ Blockchain transaction executes (NFT transfers)
- ‚úÖ Kegs ownership updated to restaurant
- ‚úÖ Receipt generated with transaction hash
- ‚úÖ Deposit calculated and recorded
- ‚úÖ All parties notified

---

## üí∞ For Your Accountant

### Monthly Reconciliation Flow

1. Open `/accounting` page
2. See summary:
   ```
   Total Deliveries: 45
   Total Kegs: 135
   Total Deposits: $4,050
   ```

3. Set date range: October 1-31
4. Click "Export CSV"
5. Open in Excel/QuickBooks
6. CSV includes:
   - Receipt numbers
   - Dates and times
   - Brewery names
   - Keg counts
   - Deposit amounts
   - **Blockchain transaction hashes** (proof)
   - Direct links to blockchain explorer

### Reconciliation is Now:
- ‚ùå ~~Hours of manual matching~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **2 minutes with CSV**
- ‚ùå ~~"Where's that receipt?"~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **All receipts searchable**
- ‚ùå ~~"Driver says they delivered 5"~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Blockchain shows truth**

## üîê Blockchain Features

### Immutable Receipts

Every accepted delivery creates:
```json
{
  "delivery_id": "abc-123",
  "blockchain_tx_hash": "0xabc123...",
  "blockchain_explorer_url": "https://basescan.org/tx/0xabc123...",
  "kegs_transferred": ["KEG-001", "KEG-002", "KEG-003"],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T14:45:00Z"
}
```

### Why This Matters

| Traditional Paper | Your New System |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Lost the receipt" | Impossible - on blockchain forever |
| "Was it 4 or 5 kegs?" | Blockchain shows exact count |
| "When did this arrive?" | Exact timestamp, immutable |
| "Who signed for this?" | Cryptographic signature proof |
| Takes hours to reconcile | Takes minutes with CSV |

## üöÄ Next Steps to Use This

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL editor or via CLI
psql -f supabase/migrations/002_deliveries_system.sql
```

### 2. Test the Flow
1. Sign in as a driver
2. Create a test delivery
3. Sign in as restaurant manager
4. Accept the delivery
5. View receipt
6. Export CSV from accounting page

### 3. Train Your Team
- Show managers: `MANAGER_QUICK_START.md` (1 page)
- Show drivers: How to create deliveries
- Show accountants: CSV export feature

### 4. Go Live!
- Drivers create deliveries when leaving brewery
- Managers accept on arrival (15 seconds)
- Accountants export monthly for reconciliation
